## Node.js Exercise
This repository contains 6 basic exercises that demonstrate how to work with Node.js. These exercises are:

Using the writeFile function, write "Hello" to a file called test.html.
Using the readFile function, read the contents of test.html and display them in the console.
Rewrite the previous exercises using ES5 or ES6 (depending on which version you used).
Install the axios module and use it to retrieve the HTML code from google.com.
...
To run these exercises, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Then, clone this repository and navigate to 
its root directory in your terminal. Here's how to run each exercise:

node writeFile.js
node readFile.js
node es5.js or node es6.js
node axios.js
Feel free to modify these exercises or add your own. Happy coding!
